# Webscraping-with-Python-and-BeautifulSoup
Webscraper for getting data of a website and exporting relevant information to a CSV file using Python and BeautifulSoup

Just a small example project for webscraping. This would be fine for Python beginners to handle url requests and responses and also handling data. <br>
<br>
<strong>I used the following URL for this project: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=GTX&N=-1&IsNodeId=1&bop=And&Page=1&PageSize=36&order=BESTMATCH">Click Here</a></strong>
<br><br>
I exported some relevant Data from single products to a CSV file.
